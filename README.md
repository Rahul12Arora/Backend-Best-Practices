    ```
    // Load environment variables from a .env file into process.env
    require('dotenv').config();
    ```
    
  Explanation: This line of code uses the dotenv package to load environment variables defined in a .env file into the process.env object. The dotenv package helps manage configuration settings by     allowing you to store sensitive information like API keys, database URLs, and other settings in a separate file. This approach enhances security and makes it easier to switch between different       configurations for development, testing, and production environments.

<li>
  
  ```
  // Import the 'express' module
const express = require('express');
  ```
  
Explanation: This code imports the express module, which is a popular framework for building web applications and APIs in Node.js. The express module provides a set of tools and features that simplify the process of creating robust and scalable web applications. It abstracts many low-level details of handling HTTP requests and responses, making it easier to define routes, middleware, and handle various aspects of web development.

<li>
  
  ```
  // Import the 'cors' middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
const cors = require('cors');
  ```

Explanation: This line imports the cors middleware, which is used to manage Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in web applications. CORS enables secure communication between different origins (domains) in browsers, allowing frontend applications to access resources from different servers while maintaining security restrictions.
</li>

<li>
  
  ```
// Import the 'body-parser' middleware for parsing incoming request bodies
const bodyparser = require('body-parser');

  ```
Explanation: This line of code imports the body-parser middleware, which is used to parse and extract data from the body of incoming HTTP requests. It's especially useful when dealing with form data, JSON payloads, and other types of data sent in requests to a server.
